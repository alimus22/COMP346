\subsection*{Question 1}
\noindent [5 pts] Give a regular expression for every string \emph{w} over \{0, 1\} where the value of \emph{w}, when interpreted as a binary number, is at least 40.

\subsection*{Answer}

\noindent In binary, 40 is: 101000.\\
\noindent A binary string of length 6 ranges from 0 to 63. Our regular expression must first cover all the possible values from 40 to 63:
\begin{align*}
    0^*1(01 + 10 + 11)(0 + 1)^3
\end{align*}
\emph{Note: $0^*$ handles possible leading zeros}\\
\noindent This regular expression only handles binary string with values between 40 and 63 inclusive.\\\\
\noindent We must also handle number greater than 63. This second part of the problem can be seen as finding 
a regular expression for all binary strings whose value is greater than or equal to 64.\\
In binary string, 64 is 1000000.\\
\noindent We must accept all binary strings with any number of leading zeros, a 1 followed by at least 6 characters:
\begin{align*}
    0^*1(0 + 1)^6(0 + 1)^*
\end{align*}
\noindent Putting the two regular expression together and simplifying, we have:
\begin{align*}
    0^*(1(0 + 1)^6(0 + 1)^* + 1(01 + 10 + 11)(0 + 1)^3)
\end{align*}
