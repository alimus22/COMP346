Part i :

We decided to use synchronize statement because implementing synchronized methods would be inefficient since 
in a multi-threading context, no methods can be invoked while a synchronized methods is already being processed. 
The implemented synchronize statement allow consistent output and account managment. 

Part ii:

No consequent running time difference were noted. This can be caused by a  fast cpu that makes the saved time
unnoticeable. However, while using busy-waiting, many CPU cycles were wasted waiting. With synchronized 
statements and semaphore, the processes are synchronized so that we lose as little CPU frames as possible.
