First the JVM counts the number of time a method is called and after a threshold is exceeded JIT compiles 
and optimizes the bytecode so that it runs faster. 
However, the main reason the program is supposed to run faster after each run is cache (even if it is not the case here 
since the CPU used for the test is very powerful, making the difference irrelavant). Indeed, cache holds data and instructions
that are frequently used and are often required by CPU operations. Cache is faster access memory than RAM givent hat it is on
the same chip as the processor. This reduces the CPU wait time for memory retrievals from main memory.
