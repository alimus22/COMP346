\noindent After modifying the \textit{pom.xml} file for \textit{apache-commons-io} project so it only tests \textit{input} and \textit{output} packages and kept only the conditional boundary, negate conditional, and return values mutators, the line coverage was at 90\%, the mutation coverage at 83\% and test strength at 89\%. The modified \textit{pom.xml} file is joined with this submission as \textit{q3.xml}.
