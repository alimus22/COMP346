\subsection*{Question 2}

\noindent Mockito allows to use "ArgumentMatchers" in order to build more flexible stubbs for better testing. \\ Using one of the different methods of the ArgumentMatchers class allows, for example, to dictate a behaviour for the stubbed object, without having to hard code any parameter value.\\ Let's look at the example in method \verb|letsMockListGetWithAny|. Using \verb|Mockito.anyInt()| method as a parameter for the \verb|get()| method of the mocked \verb|list| object, allows to stubb a common behaviour no matter the integer given as a parameter. That is why, not matter the integer (0, 1, or 22), the call \verb|list.get(int)| will return \textit{"this is an int"}.\\ Various other methods like \verb|anyString()|, \verb|anyList()|, or \verb|any(Class <T> type)| (which let you specify what class to match), are very powerful when it comes to stubbing and verifying.
