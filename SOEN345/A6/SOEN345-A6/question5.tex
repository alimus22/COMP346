\subsection*{Question 1}

\noindent It took in total 4 iterations to find the faulty commit. Note that we could have found the faulty commit in 3 iterations but the extra iterations allowed us to verify that the build for that particular commit fails, and to receive information about the faulty commit. \\ The complete process of bisecting is joined with this submission as \verb|bisecting.txt|. Note that comments on if the particular build failed or succeeded are added.
