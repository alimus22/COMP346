\noindent Even though Maven is very efficient at building projects and executing tests, Jenkins is all around better and covers all aspects of CI/CD. In my opinion, it is easier and seamless to install the plugins you want and view the results with Jenkins. The different options easily accessible (like receive email when build fails) also makes a difference. We can set our environment (JDK, Maven etc) easily, which can help avoid many mistakes. In fact, Jenkins uses Maven as a tool and incorporates (and expands on) most of its functionalities if not all.
