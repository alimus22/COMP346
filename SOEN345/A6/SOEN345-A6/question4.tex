\subsection*{Question 4}
\noindent The Docker Pipeline plugin seems very interesting. In many projects, I use Docker in order to have the exact same environment across multiple systems. It is particularly helpful while building machine learning projects with python that requires dozens of different python libraries to work. It is easier to have everything within one container and simply load the image when changing machine. Even though python is not a compiled language and therefore projects in python do not need to be built, Jenkins provide a lot of interesting functionalities that can still benefit any project and the possibility to have a plugin that offers a domain-specific-language to mimic Docker's most used operations seems very handy.
