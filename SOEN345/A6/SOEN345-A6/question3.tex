\noindent We could of course use a platform like Jenkins to verify and execute integration tests. For example, after packaging the code, Jenkins can upload it to other (internal) repos with other pieces of software. Jenkins supports a multitude of different environments (different operating systems for example) and run the integration tests. Jenkins could also be used to automate repetitive tasks as backing up a database with interesting plugins that let you manage your backups.
