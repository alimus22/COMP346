\subsection*{Question 2}
\noindent First after \verb|git bisect start| we provide a 'good' commit (i.e. a3bbceff0a9ea73215a4d\\6ff54f29e0aee102e27) and the command \verb|git bisect bad| sets the current commit as bad. Git does the binary search and checkout to a commit in between. We need to rebuild (\verb|ant clean compile|) in order to verify if that particular commit is 'good' or 'bad' and we specify the result to git bisect using the appropriate command in order for the process to continue. We do that by using \verb|git bisect good| or \verb|git bisect bad| that sets current commit as respectively good or bad. After a few iterations, the binary search is done and we are supposed to be on the faulty commit. \\ In this case, the faulty commit seems to be: 522a07e4dce45efe9ae29b740c763069c3d6d047, named 'Inline class refactoring'.
