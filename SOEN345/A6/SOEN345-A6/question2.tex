\subsection*{Question 2}
\noindent First, having a history of previous build makes it possible to quickly see the differences between each build, for examples differences in test coverage which can help to more easily understand the cause of fluctuations. This in fact can be applied to a wide variety of other development activities, not just testing. In case of failure, we can compare previous failing builds with current in order to look for similarities.
