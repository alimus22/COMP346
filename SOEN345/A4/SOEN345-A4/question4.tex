\subsection*{Question 4}

\noindent UI testing adds a layer to other testing methods by allowing the programmer to verify the correctness of certain element of the UI given different workflows or input from a user. It allows to test particularities concerning the UI that would have been harder or less intuitive to test otherwise, like the presence of certain element on the mobile version of the app. Also, with powerful tools such as Selenium, it is easy to perform a particular possible workflow and test throughout the whole process if the user interface reacts as expected. \\ UI testing definitely reduces the tester's workload. It allows the tester to quickly test everything there is to test on a certain workflow seamlessly. For example, if a certain UI element is to be retrieved in multiple pages, it is possible for the tester to verify the presence of such an element in all the pages quickly and in a single test.\\ Also, UI testing is a good practice since it participate in the separation of concerns, and thus reduces the chances of defects in the program not being found during testing phases.
