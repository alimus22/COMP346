\noindent 
\begin{enumerate}[label={\alph*)}]
    \item BlazeMeter allows to seamlessly build complex, scalable, and flexible tests by allowing the user to choose among a wide variety of tests. The way it is used directly from within the browser reminds of Selenium IDE. Tests are easily exportable to \verb|.jmx| format and can be used with JMeter for further modification, for example, modify test scale. \\ Test plan script for Part B as well as aggregate report file are joined with this submission as \verb|Part_B.jmx|, \verb|partB_aggregate.csv| respectively.
\end{enumerate}
